			<h3> 1. Can we identify key nodes in gene networks and specific cell-types, onto which multiple Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic and environmental risk factors converge? </h3>
			<p> Multiple genetic and environmental/lifestyle risk factors are known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. To result in neurodegeneration, these factors must exert a cellular and/or biochemical effect, resulting in the accumulation of
				toxic protein products, and an insufficient protective cellular response, with the ultimate consequence of neuronal death and brain atrophy. Given the diversity of genetic and environmental risk factors, an interesting and obvious question is
				-
				At what point do these factors converge? By shifting cell states of particular cell types? By activating certain genes? Or do they meet all the way downstream - and converge on neuronal death? </p>
			<h3>2. How do multiple AD genetic risk variants interact to increase risk in AD?</h3>
			<p>Current studies that dissect genetic mechanisms of AD have focused largely on the isolated effect of individual genetic risk variants, when controling for multiple covariates. Now that genome wide association studies have
				implicated ~ 29 genes in increasing disease risk, an interesting consideration is - What happens when multiple variants converge in a single individual? How does this modify risk, i.e. How do multiple genetic risk variants alter cell states
				that promote or protect against AD pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration? This is an important question, as beginning to answer it will elucidate novel mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, which might explain the observed
				transcriptomic and clinical disease heterogeneity in this disease.</p>
			<h3>3. How can we classify individuals and generate a hierarchy of AD molecular subtypes to dissect AD heterogeneity? </h3>
			<p> AD is a heterogenous disease, on the molecular and the clinical level. I strongly believe that we should redefine our understanding of AD, not as a single disease, but as a large group of distinct molecular processes initiated by diverse
				upstream risk factors that converge to the common phenotypes of amyloid deposition, tangle formation, and dementia. I am interested in using high-dimensional molecular signatures to identify functional subtypes of AD and systematically
				characterize heterogeneity of the disease. A systematic and quantitative classification of AD subtypes, akin to the classifications that inform therapeutic targets in cancer, should aid therapeutic intervention, biomarker identification of
				increased sensitivity, as well as systematic stratification of cohorts in scientific studies. </p>
			<h3>4. How can we infer spatial localization from single-cell RNA-seq data? </h3>
			<p> This is another question I am very interested in. One limitation with single-cell RNA-sequencing technology is that it removes cells from their native environment, and therefore loses the spatial component of variation that defines tissue
				architecture. Multiple studies have shown that low-throughput spatial transcriptomic data can be integrated with single-cell RNA-sequencing data to infer a pairwise distance matrix from the single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset - thus restoring
				the spatial component that was lost by single-cell transcriptomics. However, a major drawback here is that these methods require scientists to generate paired spatial and single-cell data, which is not always experimentally feasible. I am
				interested in developing probabilistic methods to infer spatial information from single-cell data alone.</p>
			<h3>These are the questions I am currently trying to tackle during my PhD. </h3>

				<h3> 1. Genetics and epigenetics: </h3>
				<p>This discipline has fascinated me since high-school. To me, this is one of the most fascinating fields in biology, which continues to change rapidly and requires sophisticated computational methods to deal with the high-dimensional
					datasets
					generated in genomics. </p>
				<h3> 2. Single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies: </h3>
				<p>This is an absolutely amazing and fascinating technology. It allows us to identify unknown celltypes and cell states in an unsupervised way. It also allows us to investigate cell-type heterogeneity within a single individual, which opens
					all
					kinds of possibilities (for example, now we can now use machine learning to classify cells within a single subject according to how pathogenic they are, how close to pathology we infer their spatial location, whether there is a
					subpopulation
					of cells, whose allelic expression is skewed... and many more interesting questions and applications.)</p>
				<h3> 3. Protein structure and function: </h3>
				<p>This is slighly out of the scope of the previous interests - But protein structure and function has always intrigued me. It's an important consideration for Alzheimer's disease too - previous research suggests that genes that are toxic
					upon
					overexpression (i.e. dosage sensitive) tend to have more intrinsically disordered regions - they might enter into promiscuous interactions in the cell and are more likley to be hubs that interact with (and thus dysregulate) multiple
					proteins
					upon overexpression <a href=https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(09)00454-1.pdf>(click here for reference)</a>.</p>

				<h3>I am part of the Tsai lab (advised by Li-Huei Tsai) in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department and the Kellis lab (advised by Manolis Kellis) in the Computer Science department.</h3>
				<h3>Tsai lab @ MIT</h3>
				<p>The Tsai lab uses a multidisciplinary approach to understand the mechanisms that cause neurodegeneration. We investigate circuit mechanisms of degeneration, epigenetic signatures of degeneration, and study the genetic risk that causes
					Alzheimer's disease. We use a range of technologies to achieve this: mouse models, in vitro models using human-derived induced-pluripotent stem cells, organoids, microfluidic devices, and human brain samples. All of these are sources of
					high dimensional datasets, including epigenomic data, transcriptomic data, and genomic sequences. Technological advances allow us to place a particular emphasis on high-dimensional datasets derived from single cells. </p>
				<p><a href="https://tsailaboratory.mit.edu/publications/"> Check out some of the Tsai lab's work</a></p>
				<h3>Kellis lab @ MIT</h3>
				<p>The Kellis lab develops new computational methods and analyzes high-dimensional biological datasets. We receive a subset of the exciting datasets generated in the Tsai lab and analyze these using new and existing computational methods.
					For
					example, to decompose single-cell data into low dimensional space, I use a method called "ACTIONet", developed by the Kellis lab. This method attempts to represent the transcriptional profile in a small number of components, assumed to
					optimally represent the transcriptional variability in the dataset, based on which cell neighborhoods are inferred.

			<h3>1. Dissecting the Role of Individual Aβ Species on AD Pathogenesis in 3D Cultured Human Neurons </h3>

			<p>Aß42 is thought to be a key mediator of pathogenesis in AD. However, the impact of Aß42 versus Aß40 and other
				Aß isoforms has not been investigated in human cellular models. During my time in the Tanzi lab at Harvard Medical School, I helped engineer a novel 3D cell culture model of AD to dissect the contribution of individual Aß species to disease
				pathogenesis. Based on recent insights into the sequential cleavage cascade of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), we found that insertion of aromatic residues at select APP transmembrane domain (TMD) positions modulates the Aß-42/40 ratio in
				cell lines over-expressing APP.
				hNPCs with various APP TMD mutations differentiated in 3D provide a novel platform with which to characterize
				the role of individual Aß species in AD pathogenesis. </p>

			<p>The guiding biochemical logic: Ɣ-secretase processes the transmembrane domain (TMD) of APP via two main pathways
				of sequential tripeptide cleavage. The enzyme initiates cleavage after
				Leu49 or Thr48, which results in the production of Aβ-40 or -42, respectively. The structure
				of the 3 S' pockets in the presenilin catalytic subunit can be exploited to direct cleavage
				towards either Aβ isoform. Recent research elucidates the structural basis of ɣ-secretase’s
				tripeptide cleavage mechanism; The enzyme’s S'2 pocket is small and does not
				accommodate large residue side-chains. Insertion of aromatic residues at TMD positions 50
				or 51 (V50F and M51W) decreases or increases the Aβ-42/40 ratio, respectively, by
				decreasing favorable interactions with the initial cleavage site of either cleavage pathway. Based on these findings, we introduced select
				mutations into the APP TMD and showed that these mutations did indeed modulate Aβ-42/40 ratios in cell lines transfected with
				these constructs. This provides a model to enable study of the Aß isoforms, as well as drug screening to modulate their ratios. This work was published as part of a study in Nature Communications, 2020. <a

				<h3>2. Analysis of transcriptomic signature of individual Aβ isoforms: </h3>

				<p> To identify gene changes associated with Aβ toxicity, I characterized the transcriptomic response of differentiated 3D-cultured AD human neurons (the cell lines I discuss in the previous point) to Aβ accumulation. Clonal AD cell lines
					were differentiated within an artificial
					extracellular matrix in 3D, which is accompanied by a robust generation of AD pathologies including amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Transcriptomic datasets were generated and integrated with transcriptomes from human temporal cortex and
					cerebellum to identify pathology-associated pathway alterations that are present in human brains. Panels A-B give a cartoon overview of this study. </p>

					<h3>3. Identifying mechanisms and biomarkers of spontaneous preterm birth</h3>

					<p>Complications following spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) constitute a major cause of neonatal death worldwide.
						Biomarkers which are predictive of sPTB early in gestation are currently unavailable, hindering effective intervention.
						I worked in Dr. Mason’s research group to conduct research for my undergraduate honors thesis, titled
						“Stratification of Cervico- Vaginal 1H NMR Metabolomics Data Reveals Biomarkers of Spontaneous Preterm Birth”.
						I analyzed vaginal microbiome and metabolome data, to identify biomarkers of
						spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) and gain insight into potential mechanisms of sPTB. These data were generated
						in the context of the INSIGHT prospective cohort study, led by chief investigators Dr. Rachel Tribe and Professor
						Andrew Shennan.
						I evaluated to what extent certain
						metadata variables, such as ethnicity, the microbiome, disease, and risk stratification, were correlated with
						variation in the vaginal metabolome. To control for confounding and test for potential effect modification, I
						investigated whether data stratification according to select metadata variables, would reveal biomarkers of sPTB,
						which are specific for certain patient cohorts. Finally, I integrated metabolome data, microbiome data, and other
						variables associated with sPTB, to evaluate the importance of these features in
						predicting sPTB in the entire and stratified cohorts. We identified multiple features that were predictive of preterm birth in data stratified according to selct metadata variables. Hierarchical stratification, using multiple biomarkers,
						may increase the specificity of predictive sPTB tests for
						clinical use.</p>

					<p>Working with these human datasets (at the time, working with patient data was a first for me) exposed me to multiple variables I had not dealt with previously. One of these was "ethnicity". This had me thinking: How is ethnicity defined?
						How are ethnicities grouped together? Based on cultural and social factors, genetics, or racist beliefs? I found a lot of interesting answers to my questions in the following resources. It became increasingly clear to me that, as
						scientists, we have a moral and social obligation to make sure we are not contributing to racist beliefs about race being grounded in biology or genetics. See this book: <a

					<h3>4. Evaluating differential gene expression methods for single-cell RNA-sequencing data</h3>
					<p>Computing differentially expressed genes (i.e. scoring the confidence with which a gene shows different expression levels between two groups) is challenging for single-cell data. Treating cells as independent observations and estimating
						differential expression based on a nonparametric rank test, for example, can result in many false positives, where single gene changes are driven by individual patients, who contribute a disproportionate number of cells to the comparison
						- The observations are not truly independent. A way around this, is to use methods traditionally designed for bulk RNA-sequencing data (which is less sparse than the single-cell equivalent). These approaches use linear models and bayesian
						statistics to estimate gene changes. We tested an additional approach, where we conducted single-cell comparisons by random sampling of a small number of individuals, followed by aggregation of the differential expression scores. I spent
						time implementing this method and benchmarked it against "traditional" pseudo-bulking methods to determine which methods to use in our studies.

					<h3>5. Evaluating GTEx data heterogeneity for differential gene expression</h3>

					<p>The Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project has quantified gene expression in human tissues from hundreds of
						individuals. During my research internship in the Getz lab, I studied differential expression in these data, for which I evaluated the outputs from two widely-used methods, Limma+Voom and DESeq2. Identifying
						differentially expressed genes in tissues is challenging due to the presence of multiple biological and technical
						confounders, including cellular heterogeneity and batch effects. For this reason, differential expression results
						have not yet been provided as part of official GTEx data releases.
						DESeq2 and Limma+Voom make different statistical assumptions about the distribution of gene expression data
						and, as a result, show vastly different results. I worked with
						randomized GTEx data to empirically test biases associated with these packages.</p>

			<h3>1. My colleague Mehdi Jorfi and I wrote this piece on the interplay between microglial states and major risk factors in Alzheimer’s disease, published in the Journal of Neurophysiology, when I first became fascinated by single-cell
				transcriptomic approaches.</h3>
			<p>Abstract: Microglia constitute ~10–20% of glial cells in the adult human brain. They are the resident phagocytic immune cells of the central nervous system and play an integral role as first responders during inflammation. Microglia
				are commonly classified as “HM” (homeostatic), “M1” (classically activated proinflammatory), or “M2” (alternatively activated). Multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing studies suggest that this discrete classification system does not
				accurately and fully capture the vast heterogeneity of microglial states in the brain. In fact, a recent single-cell RNA-sequencing study showed that microglia exist along a continuous spectrum of states. This spectrum spans
				heterogeneous populations of homeostatic and neuropathology-associated microglia in both healthy and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse brains. Major risk factors, such as sex, age, and genes, modulate microglial states, suggesting that
				shifts along the trajectory might play a causal role in AD pathogenesis. This study provides important insight into the cellular mechanisms of AD and underlines the potential of novel cell-based therapies for AD. <a

			<h3>2. We also compiled a methods protocol describing how to engineer human brain spheroids. </h3>
			<p>ABSTRACT: Self-assembling brain spheroids derived from human stem cells closely emulate the tangled connectivity of the human brain, recapitulate aspects of organized tissue structure, and are relatively easy to manipulate compared
				to other existing three--dimensional (3D) cellular models. However, current platforms generate heterogeneously--sized and short--lived spheroids, which do not robustly and reproducibly model human brain development and diseases. Here,
				we present a method to generate large--scale arrays of homogeneously--sized 3D brain spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or immortalized neural progenitor cells to recapitulate Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
				pathology in vitro. When embedded in extracellular matrix, these brain spheroids develop extensive outward projection of neurites and form networks, which are mediated by thick bundles of dendrites. This array facilitates
				cost--effective, high--throughput drug screening and mechanistic studies to better understand human brain development and neurodegenerative conditions, such as AD. <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781071611739"> View the
					chapter.</a> Have a look below to see what these neurospheroids look like when they are grown in our microfluidic chambers, after staining them fluorescently. </p>
